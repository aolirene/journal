        <h2 style="color: blue; font-size: 20px;"> 1.WEEK 1</h2>
      <p>I have always wanted to learn how to code. 
        frst week
        During my first week of the course 
        I made sure I was ontime very excited to learn everything.In that weeek I learnt about
        the internet and also downloaded VScode and git hub. Version control  simply describes how 
        you can track changes made by who and when.</p>  
       <h3 style="color: blue;font-size: 20px;"> 2.WEEK 2</h3>
        In this week I learnt about HTML where by it helps you create your own web page. I was really looking forward to 
        this class I have always wanted to learn how to create my own web page and upload my portfolio about 
        various passions of mine.Here I hadto install th live server extension and when clicked on go live it opens a live server
        in my browser so basically creating a server on my pc. so in reference on how the internet works the browser
        initiates a request to server and the server sends back info and the browser displays it.
        <p> With reference to W3 schools available on internet, we were able to go through the HTML tutorial.
            The browsers read the different elements on the HTML page and display them without tags and the rest.
            the HTML psge is divided into html, head and body.The content in the body will be displayed in the
             browser.the title element will be displayed in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
             <P class="Irene" > There are various editors one can use for their html for our case we used VScode. The HTML headings are defined
                with h1 to h6 tags where the h1 tag defines the most important heading and h6 the least important heading
             </P>

        </p>
        <h4 style="color: blue ; font-size: 20px;">WEEK 3</h4>
        <P> During this week, we learnt about CSS</P>
        <h5 style="color: turquoise ; font-size: 50px;">Summary</h5>
        <p style= "font-style:italic" class="flower;" id="summary">All in all my biggest challenge has been me joining the classes late as my work ends at 6:00pm and the classes start 
            at 5:30pm.It has been difficult to follow through too as you be exhausted and it gets worse when the recordings are uploaded
            late. Thus you go i nto the next class abit frustrated.Scheduling time to balance between work and class has been 
            difficult but I adjusted and am now progressing steadily.
            Nevertheless I have been able to catch up using the recordings which gives me some satisfaction.
